# Reinforcement-Learning
This repository is used as a database to store the progress in my journey to learning about Reinforcement Learning, its techniques and algorithms as well as their implementation in code using python.

### Project#1 - Cliff Walking

In this project implemented SARSA and Q-Learning Agent with Greedy-Epsilon Policy to solve the cliff walking problem. The cliff walking problem environment can be found at the OpenAI Gymnasium.
